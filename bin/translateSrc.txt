In general, real users have relative stable preference when selecting items, so the similarity
between the selected items by real users is usually high. However, the spammer purchas-
ing behaviors are assigned by the Internet water army company. Therefore, the similarity
among the items purchased by spammers tend to be low. Based on the above assumption,
we design the following algorithm based on KNN apporach to improve the robustness of
recommendation algorithms. First, we calculate the average similarity between all the items
selected by a user, and denote it as a vector !. The vector ! will be used to improve the
KNN approach. Instead of adopting the  fraction of users with highest diffusion score f,
