We respectively calculate precision, ranking score, diversity and novelty in the case of
=0, 0.5, 1, 2 with the improved KNN approach. We found that for the improved KNN
approach, when  = 2, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve both the diversity
and the recommendation accuracy in comparison with the original KNN approach. In Fig.
4 and Fig. 5, the horizontal axis is KNN ratio  from 0.01 to 0.3. Specifically, Fig. 4 (a)(b)
show the results of precision, Fig. 4 (c)(d) show the results of ranking score. Fig. 5 (a)(b)
show the results of diversity, Fig. 5 (c)(d) show the results of novelty. Obviously, when
 = 2, the new algorithm performs much better than the original KNN approach, both in
the recommendation accuracy and recommendation diversity.
